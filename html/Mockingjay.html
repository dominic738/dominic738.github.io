<h2>Its the Hunger Games. Yeah.</h2>

<h4>The Hunger Games MockingJay was pretty good. It takes place after the 75th Hunger Games. Since Katniss destroyed the arena, the peacekeepers
    bombed the districts because people saw what was going on with the arena. Peeta and Johanna are captured by the capitol and Katniss and the others
    are rescued by district 13. Coin (The prez of district 13) starts the Mockingjay army with Katniss being the Mockingjay. They fight
    back against the capitol to stop the Hunger Games and rescue Peeta and Johanna. After rescuing them they go to the capitol and fight back.
    Oh yeah also Finnick dies :(. When they get to the capitol the capitol says that there will be food water and shelter at the capitol instead bombing everyone
    including Prim :(. President Snow eventually resigns and Coin announces that she will continue the Hunger Games when everyone is gathered to kill Snow.
    Katniss is about to kill Snow but instead shoots Coin killing her. Then all the other people kill Snow ending the series.
