        <p>I love the Hunger Games franchise. I love it so much that I'm doing a whole website on it. 
        But if I had to choose the best movie in the series, it would be the first one, The Hunger Games.
        THG Cathing Fire and both of the THG Mockingjay were good, but not as great as the first movie. The reason
        why I like the first movie better than all the others was because it really showed you the protagonists,
        the storyline, and how the games work. It told us about careers (people who spend their whole life training for the Hunger Games), all the districts
        *SPOILER ALERT* except for district 13, and all the rules of the games.</p>

    <h2>The tributes ,the weapons, and the victors</h2>
    
    <div class="head2">
    
    <p>In the first movie most of the tributes didn't reveal their names to the viewers because they were all dead in the first 10 minutes of the game.
        But the other tributes names were revealed. I'm only going to list the important tributes in the 74th Hunger Games</p>
